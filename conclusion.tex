\section{Going further with the framework}

Computing the context switching time with the PSLab is the best way.
But, we could also use the idea behind the first approach to improve the framework.
With the extension approach, it is possible to store more data in a cache while the application runs.
Such information could be the memory usage of the application but also some statistics of the task utilization.
It would possible to determine which task runs the most or which interrupt is the most called.
Those data stored in the cache would be written on the serial port at appropriate times.

Moreover, the PSLab can be used to measure the power consumption of the boards.
