In order to measure the context switching time, we have imagined to build our framework as a proxy between the interrupts and the tasks.
In this way, our framework would be able to intercept interrupts and context switchs to measure them as show in the figure \ref{fig:proxy-framework}.

However, our main concern was to implement a framework that measure the context switching time without altering it.
Indeed, we do not want our framework to slow down the application and adding an overhead.
To discuss this issue, we have contacted and discussed with some of the IoT communities.
Via mailing lists, we communicated with the communities of RIOT OS, Contiki, FreeRTOS, mBed OS and Apache Mynewt.
We also exchanged idea with IoT developers through forums on the web.
The different communities could give us some advices and help us elaborate our three approaches.
These three approaches are described in this chapter.
