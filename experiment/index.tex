\chapter{Experiment \label{chap:experiment}}

Before we start to develop our framework, we have contacted and discussed with some of the IoT communities.
Via mailing lists, we communicated with the communities of RIOT OS, Contiki, FreeRTOS, mBed OS and Apache Mynewt.
We also exchanged idea with IoT developers through forums on the web.
Our main concern was to implement a framework that measure the context switching time without altering it.
Indeed, we do not want our framework to slow down the application and adding an overhead.

Unfortunately, the communities and the developpers could not help us.
So, we decided to consider three different approaches.
