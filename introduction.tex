%RTOS and IoT their impact and interconnections
\subsection*{Embedded Systems, Real-Time Operating Systems and Internet of Things}

Embedded Systems have been around since a while now.
%http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/news/magazine/aeroastro6/mit-apollo.html
One of the well known first modern embedded system was the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) designed in the 60's
    which contributed to the monumental success of sending a man on the Moon.
By its design, the software that was developped for it would become a precursor of what is now known as Real-Time Operating Systems.
Although not necessarly, Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) are well often used inside embedded systems and countless examples exist to prove it.
We already mentionned the aerospace industry which is certainly in high demand of embedded systems, 
    but we can also mention the automotive, medical or military industries.
From a more consumer point of view we can mention home automation, digital cameras or even washing machines.

In the past two decades, embedded devices benefited from the explosion of the Internet which brought them 
    the ability to communicate and interact with each other and more globally with anything connected to the Internet.
The age of the Internet of Things (IoT) as it is called brought countless of new applications for embedded systems.
Billions of those connected devices are now in use as of today with no sign of getting out of trend.

%Benchmarking of RTOS
\subsection*{Benchmarking of Real-Time Operating Systems}

A benchmark is a tool designed to assess the performances of a system.
In computer science, softwares are used to benchmark the performances of computer hardware but also softwares.

Compilers or database management systems (dbms) are a good example; many tools are available to benchmark them such as HammerDB.

Preliminary researches we made for this thesis revealed that solutions already exist in order to benchmark real-time operating systems.
We can cite \texttt{MiBench}, an embedded benchmark suite and also \texttt{ParMiBench}, its equivalent for multiprocessor systems.

We then came up with the idea of building a benchmarking tool not to benchmark the operating systems but the applications built on top of them.

%riot summit
\subsection*{RIOT Summit 2018}
In September 2018, we went to the RIOT Summit 2018 in Amsterdam in order to meet developers and researchers specialized in the RTOS area.

This was the third summit of the RIOT community.
Every year the members of the community gather and talk about their projects and the future work for RIOT-OS.
The summit was divided into two days. 
During the first day, 12 speakers presented their work. 
On the second day, tutorials were given and breakout groups ended the summit.

By talking to developers that were present at the summit, we learned that the STM32F4 series microcontroller is a good choice to perform a benchmark on RTOS. 
With its ARM Cortex-M4 based MCU, it compiles a large variety of RTOS.

Additionaly, we discussed about our idea to use a logical analyzer to perform time analysis. 
Gilles Doffe from Savoir-faire Linux confirmed our opinion about using this kind of devices for our benchmarking.

During this summit, we discovered a large number of application of RIOT-OS and RTOS in general.
We talked to some of the maintainers of RIOT-OS and other developers. 
With their expertise and their advices, we got references to hardwares and softwares that could be useful for our work.
