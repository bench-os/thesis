\section*{RIOT Summit 2018}
We went to the RIOT Summit 2018 in Amsterdam in order to meet developers and researchers specialized in the RTOS area.

This was the third summit of the RIOT community.
Every year the members of this community gather and talk about their projects and the future work for RIOT-OS.
The summit was divided into two days. During the first day, 12 speakers presented their work. On the second day, tutorials were given and breakout groups ended the summit.

By talking to developers that were present at the summit, we learned that the STM32F4 series microcontroller is a good choice to perform a benchmark on RTOS. With its ARM Cortex-M4 based MCU, it compiles a large variety of RTOS.

Additionaly, we talked about our idea to use a logical analyser to perform time analysis. Gilles Doffe from Savoir-faire Linux confirmed our opinion about using this kind of devices for our benchmarking.

During this summit, we discovered a large number of application of RIOT-OS and RTOS in general.
We talked to some of the maintainers of RIOT-OS and other developers. With their expertise and their advices, we got references to hardwares and softwares that could be useful for our work.
