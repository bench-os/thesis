\chapter{Results and framework measurements \label{chap:results}}

This chapter gives all the measurements gathered during our experiments.
Those results are given without any comment.
Each presented plot has a logarithmic y-axis.
The chapter \ref{chap:discuss} discusses the results and compare the two approaches.
Section \ref{sect:overhead} gives measures of the impact of the different approaches.
Section \ref{sect:frame-measure} gives the obtained measurements with the two approaches.

For each approach, 1000 measurements were made with the two RTOS, Contiki and RIOT, and on the two boards, the RE-Mote and the Z1 boards for a total of 4000 measurements. 
From these measurements, the statistics used were the mean, the minimum and the maximum.
