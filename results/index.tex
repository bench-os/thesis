\chapter{Results and framework measurements \label{chap:results}}

This chapter give the all the measurements gathered during our experiments.
Those results are given without any comment.
Each presented plot have a logarithmic y-axis.
The chapter \ref{chap:discuss} discusses the results and compare the two approaches.
The first section gives mesures of the approaches impact.
The second section gives the obtained measurements with the two approaches.

For each approach, 1000 measurements were made on the two RTOS, Contiki and RIOT, and on the two boards, the RE-Mote and the Z1 boards for a total of 4000 measurements. From these measurements, the statistics used were the mean, the minimum and the maximum.
