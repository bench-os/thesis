\chapter{Theory of RTOS\label{part:rtos-theory}}

\paragraph{}
In order to understand how an RTOS works compared to a general purpose operating system,
    it is essential to define some reccurent characteristics we'd expect to find in a real-time architecture.
\\
This chapter is non exhaustive and one can debate about the importance of one relative to one other.
We decided to chose those characteristics because they are commonly used in the litterature
    and we think that they will provide a good glance at what we can expect from an RTOS.

The first part of this thesis is the result of an effort from ours to summarize the knowledge we collected during our researches.
We spent countless hours collecting data, reading papers, documentation and technical datasheets from vendors, researchers and developpers.
We also spent time contacting qualified people to review, read and advise us on very specific topics.
