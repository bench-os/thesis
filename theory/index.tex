\chapter{Theory of RTOS\label{part:rtos-theory}}

In order to understand how a real-time operating system (RTOS) works compared to a general purpose operating system (OS),
    it is essential to define some recurrent characteristics we would expect to find in a real-time architecture.
\\
This chapter is non-exhaustive and we could debate about the importance of some characteristics compared to some others.
We decided to choose those characteristics because they are commonly used in the literature
    and we think that they will provide a good glance at what we can expect from an RTOS.

%useful or not?
The first part of this thesis is the result of an effort from ours to summarize the knowledge we collected during our research.
We spent countless hours collecting data, reading papers, documentation and technical datasheets from vendors, researchers and developers.
We also spent time contacting qualified people to review, read and advise us on very specific topics.
