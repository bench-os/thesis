\section{Contiki measurements distribution}

By comparing the mesures made with Contiki to the one made with RIOt, we notice a huge difference.
With RIOT, the standard deviation is 31.16ns with the RE-Mote board and 27.61ns with the Z1 board.
With Contiki, the standard deviation is $10\mu s$ with the RE-Mote board and $54\mu s$ with the Z1 board.
The figure \ref{fig:deviation-ref-value} clearly show the difference between the distribution of the reference value between Contiki and RIOT.

At this point, we do not know where this difference comes from.
