\chapter{Discussion and comparison of the approaches\label{chap:discuss}}

During our experiments, we have tried to measure the context switching time of a RTOS with two different approaches.
In this chapter, we discuss and interprate the obtained results described in the previous chapter \ref{chap:results}.
From those results, we describe four observations that we have made in the following sections.
