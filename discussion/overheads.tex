\section{Extension framework overhead issue\label{sec:overhead}}

Our first approach, the extension framework, add to our simple application a large overhead of more than 2ms.
This is an issue for our benchmarking framework as it should have a minimal impact on our application.

\subsection{Causes}

This overhead is due to the way of how the measurements are send from the board to the computer.
Indeed, to retrieve the measurements, the framework writte the value on the serial port.
However, printing out at least 32 characters for every context switch on the serial port even at 250 kbit/s took 1.2ms.

\subsection{Solutions and improvements}

To improve the extension framework, one optimization could be to reduce the number of bits send through the serial port.
By sending compressed data and using only a small number of bytes, it could be possible to reduce the overhead.
But even with 8 bits for the flag an 32 bits for the value, 40 bits would take up to $160\mu s$ to be transmitted.

In addition to compress the data, another solution would be to use a cache storing the measurements.
This cache would be flushed and the values written on the serial port at appropriate times.
Either when the cache is full or with a framework method that would allow the developer to choose when to flush the cache.

\subsection{Overhead of the devices framework}

In the other hand, the devices framework have a small impact on the system with an overhead of less than $3\mu s$.
Even if it is a small overhead, it is however present.
Our hypothesis on this overhead is that the framework calls have an impact on the system. % TODO Elaborate
