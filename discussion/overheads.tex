\section{Extension approach overhead issue\label{sec:overhead}}

With our first approach, the framework adds to our simple application a large overhead of more than 2ms for every context switch.
This is an issue for our benchmarking framework as it should have a minimal impact on our application.
With such an overhead, the RTOS loose its real-time capabilities.
It become impossible for the RTOS to react in time to interrupts.

\subsection{Causes}

Sending measurements throught the serial port create this latency.
Indeed, the framework send a string that contains the measured value in order for the computer to read it.
For example, the listing \ref{lst:print-string} shows how the framework write the measurements on the serial port with the method \texttt{printf()} with Contiki

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle, float, label={lst:print-string}, caption={writting the measurements to the serial port with Contiki}]
  printf("[BENCH_CONTEXT_SWITCHING] %lu %lu %lu\n", previous_id, bench_context.new_id, result);
\end{lstlisting}

The string \texttt{[BENCH\_CONTEXT\_SWITCHING]} is a flag used to differenciate framework outputs from the application outupts.
However, printing out at least 32 characters for every context switch on the serial port even at 250 kbit/s took 1.2ms.

\subsection{Solutions and improvements}

To improve the extension approach, one optimization could be to reduce the number of bits send through the serial port.
By sending compressed data and using only a small number of bytes, it could be possible to reduce the overhead.
But even with 8 bits for the flag an 32 bits for the context switching time, 40 bits would take up to $160\mu s$ to be transmitted.

In addition to compress the data, another solution would be to use a cache storing the measurements.
This cache would be flushed and the values written on the serial port at appropriate times.
Either when the cache is full or with a framework method that would allow the developer to choose when to flush the cache.
This way, the overhead occurs not at each context switch but only at appropriate time.

\subsection{Overhead of the devices approach}

In the other hand, the devices approache have a small impact on the system with an overhead of less than $3\mu s$ per context switch.
Even if it is a small overhead, it is however present.
Our hypothesis on this overhead is that the framework calls, \texttt{bench\_on()} and \texttt{bench\_off()} have an impact on the system.
However, there is no fact supporting this conclusion.
