\chapter{RTOS outline}

In this chapter, we will cover the specificities of each operating system we chose to work with.
We chose to write about technical and non-technical characteristics of the chosen OS's and even their respectives projects as a whole.

Some of the things written in this chapter are personal opinions.
Indeed, as we decided to include non-technical characteristics of each of the projects, some subjectivity is involved.
We tried to be critical and impartial in those points but it beware it only reflects our own opinions.

A table summarizing the comparison is provided at the end of the chapter.
