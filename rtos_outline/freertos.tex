The FreeRTOS kernel has been developped in 2003 by \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-barry-4562262/}{Richard Barry}. %fix href pls
He founded a company called Real Time Engineers Ltd to develop and maintain FreeRTOS until the stewardship of the project was passed to Amazon Web Services in 2017.
Since then, we can distinguish the FreeRTOS kernel and Amazon FreeRTOS which includes the aforementioned kernel 
    with a set of libraries extending the functionalities of the RTOS.

Its strength comes from the fact that it is highly and easily configurable.
